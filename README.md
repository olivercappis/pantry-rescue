# Pantry Rescue

## Description

This project was inspired to solve a couple of issues that we have all run into. The first problem being having food but no idea what to cook with it, and the second being buying groceries that you never end up using. We wanted to build a website to help solve both of those issues in a simple and easy to use manner. We created a website that allows users to input any number of ingredients that they have, and then click a button that will link them to 20 recipes they can chose from that include those ingredients. Throughout this project all of us who worked on it were able to gain experience with searching for new frameworks, third party apis, and server side api calling.
